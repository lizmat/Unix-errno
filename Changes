Revision history for Unix-errno

{{$NEXT}}

0.0.2  2018-04-30T16:42:31+02:00
    - make sure that string and value match in .gist
    - removed debug code when trying to set errno
    - changed to exporting a "errno" and "set_errno" subs
      Turns out you cannot currently export a variable that has a Proxy
      container rather than a Scalar container.  So any changes after the
      first FETCH of the C-library variable would not be seen.

0.0.1  2018-04-30T11:40:35+02:00
    - Initial version
