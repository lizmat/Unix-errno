    - make sure that string and value match in .gist
    - removed debug code when trying to set errno
    - changed to exporting a "errno" and "set_errno" subs
      Turns out you cannot currently export a variable that has a Proxy
      container rather than a Scalar container.  So any changes after the
      first FETCH of the C-library variable would not be seen.
